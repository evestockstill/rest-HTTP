  <h1>Rest and HTTP</h1>
  <p>Rest stands for representational state transfer
    It is a Architecture style for designing networked applications
    relies on a stateless client-server protocol most of the time http
    it treats the server objects as resources that can be created or destroyed
    works in most programming language.</p>
  <p> A couple useful analogies are a server in a restaurant is like a api that brings you the information that you
    asked for in a specific order exactly how you asked for it but you have to order off the menu without substitutes.
    the second one is like a child toy that has a square shape circle and triangle shape. You have to put them in
    exactly like that or it does not work. Think of it like the api standard. </p>
  <p>Http methods
    <br> GET : Retrieve data from a specified resource <br>
    POST : submit data to be processed to a specific resource <br>
    PUT update a specified resource <br>
    DELETE : delete a specific resource.
